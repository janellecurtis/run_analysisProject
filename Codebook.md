## Raw data

The raw data originally comes from Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto at Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory, DITEN - Universit√† degli Studi di Genova.
The data came from experiments done on 30 volunteers using accelerometer and gyroscope readings from a smart phone.  There were 6 different activities tracked for each volunteer.

The variables originally included in the data set are explained below.

The features selected for this data set come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

For each of these variables, many statistical summary variables were calculated, but only mean and standard deviation are used in run_analysis.R.

The activities tracked in this study were as follows:
*WALKING
*WALKING_UPSTAIRS
*WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
*SITTING
*STANDING
*LAYING

## Transformations

The mean and standard deviation values for each variable were extracted for every data point.  The data was separated into 180 groups based on subject (30 subjects) and activity (6 activities).
For each group, the average was calculated and reported for each variable.  Variable names are consistent with the raw data, with either mean() or std() labels.
